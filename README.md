Micro V2
Design Prompt: Build a V2, using v0 Components :-)
Why? Why not.
Actual reasons:
● Fun way to screw around and make a V0 more interesting
● Better Z and bed leveling: self-leveling, no leadscrews to wobble or source, and avoids cantilevered bed
mounting
● Cheap way to see what a V2 is like from a software side
Design goals
● Use as much V0.1 stuff as possible:
○ Toolhead (extruder + hotend): V0.1 Mini-AB
○ XY Drive: F623ZZ bearings, GT2 belt, 20t pulleys, NEMA14 motors
○ Motion: MGN7H 150mm rails and carriages
○ Frame: something like 200mm 1515 (see below)
○ Bed: 120x120
○ Tophat?
● Use as much V2.4 (scaled-down) as possible:
○ Idler design?
● Printability?
○ Zruncho: Printability on a v0 should be a bonus but ideally not required. It just makes things more
complicated if you have to split stuff up.
● Exist quickly and be fun to build
Expected additional BOM costs (~100 only)
● 2x additional 150mm rails and carriages
● 3x extra motor drivers + a board to handle them
● 3x endstop switches
● 4x pulleys + belt
