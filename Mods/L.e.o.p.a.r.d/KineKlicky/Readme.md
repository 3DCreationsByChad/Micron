This mod contains an alternate 'klicky' style probe, and mount for Micron.

10 4mm-diameter by 4.7mm (often sold as 4mm x 5mm) magnets are required.

Why would you use this mod?

- It does what Klicky does, but is :
  - likely more robust to things like getting dust/grease stuff on the magnets.
  - doesn't allow sliding, so for those of us like me who have the probe slide around when probing (especially when the gantry isn't level to start), you won't have the same repeatability issues.
  - The dock is backwards compatible with klicky (you can use the standard klicky magnet with it), but it places the probe-holding magnet farther away from the probe, so it takes less force for the probe to be picked up. If your magnets lose some strength due to being hot, this can be the difference between klicky works, and it doesn't work. You may want to use this dock (or something like it) even if you don't use the rest!

What do you have to do to use this mod?
Print the mount and probe and dock, and optionally, but recommended, the tool.

Insert magnet into dock into desired orientation (if you have a klicky probe, insert the magnet in an orientation that attracts the old klicky probe.
You may want to use flat pliers or a vice or something similar to really force the magnet into its correct position, if you can't do it with your fingers. This will be true for all of the magnet installations.

Next, install the switch in the probe, and affix with screws. The notch tells you where the switch should be orientated.,
Install magnets into the sockets that will make contact with the switch-- the magnets should be oriented to pull towards the dock.
The last magnet in the probe should then be installed, and it too should pull towards the dock.
Next, move onto the mount, and install wires into the mount. The wire should come in one hole, wrap around the side-edge and down in the notch, and out the other hole.
Then, install magnets into the mount. Make sure that as you install the magnets in the mount:
  - The magnets that are next to each other have the same polarity (this means they'll NOT want to be next to each other)
  - The magnets do want to be next to the probe magnet that'd mate with it.
Inserting the second magnet in each pair is definitely harder than the first. 

Then, you're done, and you should be able to test continuity of the whole thing and verify it'll work.
Be sure that the installations of all the magnets are flat. Use pliers or a vice or whatever to make this the case, and you'll be a happy camper.
