This mod contains an alternate 'klicky' probe mount for Micron.

This is the same shape as the stock Micron Klicky probe, but printed in two separate pieces.

This is useful for ensuring that you can mount the klicky magnets flat and parallel using simple flat surfaces, like a vise or wrench, or two pieces of glass..

You can optionally glue the pieces together optionally with whatever to make things easier, but this isn't required-- the mounting screws for the probe should keep everything together.
