This mod contains various clips for mounting things onto 1515 and 2020 extrusion.

It is assumed that panels will be sized by default to go from the inner edges of the outer extrusion.
This is true for the Voron V2 and V0, Micron, and probably others.
Parts labeled 'undersized_by' refer to that many millimeters shorter than that default distance if a pair of clips are used.
A part labeled "Nmm", e.g. 3mm will have a .1mm clearance to allow for ABS shrinkage.

Half-steps can be done by using one clip of size X, and another a step down together.

corner_panel_clips are for mounting panels at the inner-corners of two extrusions.
panel_clips are for mounting panels on an extrusion not at a corner.
binding_clips are for binding two extrusion together. I used this to do a good job of sanding extrusions to be the same length.

Removal of clips may require shoving a screwdriver into the extrusion channel to lever it up, unless you can push it off the end of the extrusion.
