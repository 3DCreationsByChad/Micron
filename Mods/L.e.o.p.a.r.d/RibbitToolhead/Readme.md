This mod contains a new toolhead for Micron and similar MGN9C front-facing rail machines.

No additional hardware is needed.

Why would you use this mod?

- The part fans blow more directly on the parts. This probably reduces losses and improves cooling.
- The toolhead allows for directly mounting klicky-style probes, which means that all of the electrical can be attached to the toolhead, making maintenance a bit easier.
- For Micron, and possibly other similar gantries, this toolhead is about 18 thinner in 'x', meaning you can potentially get 18mm more travel in x using the same gantry, depending on how far foward the toolhead goes (if the legs interfere with the front extrusions, you get less overall 'x', so this matters).

What do you have to do to use this mod?
Print it. Install heatsets if using the variation with the probe-mount on the shroud.
Move it around and be sure it doesn't interfere with things badly.
