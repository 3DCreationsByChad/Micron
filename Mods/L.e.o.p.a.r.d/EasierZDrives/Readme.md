This mod contains an alternate z-drive.
It requires 8 M3x6 screws, and 4 M3x20 screws, and 7 heatsets.

Why would you want to use this?

It:
* Mounts more securely, with three bolts into three different locations on the frame
* Doesn't require full disassembly when you want to do some maintenance-- you can take the bottom half off without disassembling the whole foot, and you can see the shaft-assembly working while that is done.
* Has some holes through which you can look through because "Pretty" and "Fun!"
* Has the hex-nut for the foot captive. You can remove the foot, and be confident you can re-install it without disassembling the machine.
* You can remove the whole foot without disassembling it too. Not sure when that would be useful, but hey, you can!
* Provides more clearance for belt adjustment for the motor.

So.. yeay, and why not?!
