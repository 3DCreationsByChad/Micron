This mod contains a z-idler that can optionally take a heatset.
If you use it, you can then put the screw in from the top instead of from the bottom.
If your panels are easy to remove (e.g. you're using the Clips mod), this is going to be easier to assemble and maintain.
.. and it is backwards compatible anyway!
