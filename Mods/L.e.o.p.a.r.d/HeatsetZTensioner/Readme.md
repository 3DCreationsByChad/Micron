This mod contains a z-idler that can optionally take a heatset.
If you use it, you can then put the screw in from the top instead of from the bottom.
If your panels are easy to remove (e.g. you're using the Clips mod), this is going to be easier to assemble and maintain.
.. and it is backwards compatible anyway!

If you do not use the "safer_z_idler", then you should assemble (from the top) by:
* Put hexnut into z-idler as usual.
* Place z-tensioner in appropriate position.
* Screw screw through the hexnut and into the z-tensioner

This will ensure that it is impossible to bottom out the screw into the belt!

Alternately, just use the "safer_z_idler", which adds the appropriate clearnace (and which works with a hexnut in the "usual" way too).

With the "no_shims" variants, unsurprisingly, no shims are needed. Just insert the bearings and affix with pins or screws!
