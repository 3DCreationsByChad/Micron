This mod contains a z-tensioner that can optionally take a heatset, and an optional (though recommended) alternate z-idler.
If you use it, you can then put the screw in from the top instead of from the bottom, which can make dealing with tensioning easier.
You'll want to use an M3x12.

If you do not use the "safer_z_idler", then you should assemble (from the top) by:
* Put hexnut into z-idler as usual.
* Place z-tensioner in appropriate position.
* Screw screw through the hexnut and into the z-tensioner

This will ensure that it is impossible to bottom out the screw into the belt!

Alternately, just use the "safer_z_idler", which adds the appropriate clearnace (and which works with a hexnut in the "usual" way too).
