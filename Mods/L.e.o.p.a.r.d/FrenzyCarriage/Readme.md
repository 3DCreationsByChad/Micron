This mod contains a new carriage for Micron and similar MGN9C front-facing rail machines.

No additional hardware is needed, however, if you wish to use the self-tapping screws, you'll want to use the (backwards compatible) motor plate.

Why would you use this mod?

- There is less stuff in the way of airflow for hotend cooling.
- The mount is more rigid than the stock "kitty" mount.
- For Micron, this moves the AB motors to be clear of all the bed-mount extrusions, and allows arbitrary placement of the bed/bed-mount extrusions.

What do you have to do to use this mod?
For Micron:
- Adjust Z rail heights
  - (Recommended) Move your z-rails up to accomodate the new gantry-to-nozzle distance. If you do this, you'll lose no 'z' travel. Use the included key to get the distance right.
   or
  - Change config to reduce max-z travel by 12.5.
- Print the carriage and the motor-plate pieces.
- Insert 4 heatsets into the carriage (two on the front, two on the legs).
- Insert 2 heatsets into the motor-plate in the standard locations for a V0.1 motor-plate.
- (optional) Screw motor plate into carriage using 2.5mm self-tapping screws (as you would for a V0) using the *top* screw holes (the bottom screw-holes are for use on a V0.1 mount).
- Install toolhead as usual. Note that on the V0.1, the middle screw will be going into plastic. This should be fine, but don't overtorque!
