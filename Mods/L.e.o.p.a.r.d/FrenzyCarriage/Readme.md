This mod contains a new carriage for Micron and similar MGN9C front-facing rail machines.

No additional hardware is needed, however, if you wish to use the self-tapping screws, you'll want to use the (backwards compatible) motor plate.

Why would you use this mod?

There is less stuff in the way of airflow for hotend cooling.
The mount is more rigid than the stock "kitty" mount.
