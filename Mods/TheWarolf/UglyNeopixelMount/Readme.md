This is a simple, ugly, piece to secure your led strip to the 1515 extrusions. It's heavily inspired by Eddie work on 2020 led mount (the "ugliness" of this mount is entirely my fault though).

The size of the slot for the strip, as well as the heigth of the piece are modeled following the WS2812B RGBW strip I had laying around, thus it may or may not fit all led strips.
Considering how each 1515 brand can differ slightly, and the fact that printing tolerances/material will play a role in such a tiny printed piece, I modeled 4 versions of the mount:

- STD: is the one me and Hartk are using, printed in abs. 
- Plus1: same as STD, but the lip piece is bigger by 0.1 mm.
- Minus1: same as STD, but the lip piece is smaller by 0.1mm.
- Minus2: same as STD, but the lip piece is smaller by 0.2mm.

It's highly recommended to print just a couple of pieces to test fit them before committing to a full plate.
