This is a toolhead design for mounting LGX Lite on Micron, but with the nozzle moved forward by 2.2mm for carriage printability. You need to print the Body, Cover and Probe _Attachment, plus carriage if you are not using CNC aluminum carriage.

For the machined carriage, the middle 2 holes need to be tapped M3.

You need to print the Clicky_Probe_Mount_Attachment and attach to the carriage using 2 M2x6 self-tapping screws.
