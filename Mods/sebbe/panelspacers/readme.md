<h1> Spacers for side panels & rear panel, may need to be reoriented in slicer.</h1>
<h1> Psst.. If you have a switchwire or 250 voron, make sure to turn them 45deg in slicer to utilize the diagonal..</h1>
<h3> Reason: Belt rubs on rear panels if using 1mm foamtape only & rail carts rub on side panels (same reason). Solution? Spacers!!! </h3>
