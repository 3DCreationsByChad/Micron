Relocates the pi so the bottom doesn't face the bottom panel (shorting risk), and GPIO is more accessible. Also moves the PSU lower to make the USB connectors of the Pi more accessible (still a tight fit but it can work with some shaving of the plastic on the USB cable if needed). Alternatively, Pi 3s USB connectors are on the other side of the PCB, so 2 of the USBs should be easily accessible.

Also adds an extra latch for extra security.

There are 2 versions of the Pi mount, with M2 self-tapper screws or with M2.5 inserts. I like using inserts where possible, and M2.5 is the correct screw size for a Raspberry Pi, so this is what I use. The M2.5 inserts I used can be found on [Aliexpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9gw57l), size M2.5 X D4.2 X L3.6.
