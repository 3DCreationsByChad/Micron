# Simpler Electronics
![Example](./IMG/1.PNG)
<br>
I wasn't a fan of the hinged electronics (below), so I created this. Less files to print, less screws and inserts needed, more accessible Pi, and no hinge.
<br>
The PSU is VHB taped or screwed to the deck panel, the Octopus mount is VHB taped on the PSU. Pi mounts to a side skirt.
<br>
There are 2 versions of the Pi skirt, with M2 self-tapper screws or with M2.5 inserts. I like using inserts where possible, and M2.5 is the correct screw size for a Raspberry Pi, so this is what I use. The M2.5 inserts I used can be found on [Aliexpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9gw57l), size M2.5 X D4.2 X L3.6.

### Why I didn't like the hinge?
1. Wire management was difficult. Managing wires to not go under the PSU was difficult. Wires under the PSU means you con't lock the latch.
2. It was unnecessary. Hinge doesn't make accesing the components easier. The PSU is still screwed under the Octopus, blocking the DC side.
3. Pi mounting location wasn't ideal. You needed to remove screws to access the Pi, and the bottom side was facing the bottom panel, increasing shorting risk (if bottom panel is ACM). I designed [a mod](../Vertical_Pi) to fix this if you still want the hinge.
